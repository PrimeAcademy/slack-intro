# Slack

## Set up
- Username: First and Last name makes it easy. 
- Profile photo: an image of your face is best!
- Install the [Desktop Slack app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/slack/id803453959)
 - There is a browser version, but with the frequency that Slack will be used, installing the app is waaay better.
- There is also an app for iOS and Android.

## Tale of Two Slacks
Yes, use them both!
### On Campus Slack: All current students and staff at Prime
https://primeacademycampus.slack.com

### All Prime Slack: All Prime students, alumni, and staff
- https://primeacademy.slack.com
- Great for connecting with Alumni
- Prime has a positive and helpful alumni community. Don't be afraid to reach out!
- \#diveristy-inclusion is a great channel that focusses on resources and discussion around diversity and inclusion in the industry.

## Using Slack

Check your cohort channel daily.
There will be updates, announcements, resources, questions...
You may also occasionally receive direct messages from Prime staff on Slack. 

Asking for help should be done in the cohort's channel, not directly to instructors or peers. Others will have similar questions.

Instructors will regularly check the Slack channel and answer questions.

Have Slack open when working on Prime stuff. This makes is easier to keep up to date, post questions as they come up or respond to others' questions.

### Threads
Threads are a great way of organizing and containing conversations, or discussing questions. To start a thread, hover over the post that you want to respond to and then the "Start a thread" text bubble symbol will show up. Click on that and you can start a thread!

### Pinned items
Pinned items are posts in a channel that can be useful for everyone to reference. You can view pinned items by clicking on the thumbtack icon at the top of a channel:

![hover over thumbtack icon](view-pinned.png "How to view pinned items")

The pinned items for that channel will then open up of the side to scroll through:

### Code Blocks

You can post lines of code or blocks of code in Slack using the backtick \` that is up by the esc key.

A line surrounded by single backticks will look like this: `var subject = 'world'`

For a multi-line code block, start with three back ticks \``` on their own line. Then post the code, and then close the code block with a line of three backticks. 

```
function hello(planet){
   console.log('Hello,', planet);
}
```

### Weekly Discussion
Whoever responds to the discussion question first will make the first post in the cohort channel.

Then that post can be pinned to make it easy to find.

Everyone else will reponse to the Weekly Discussion in a thread under the first response. 

### Asking and Answering questions in Slack
When asking a question, try to be descriptive. This can be difficult since the language is all new to you.
You can also post a piece of your code or a link to your code if needed.

## FAQ

### Is it okay to post my questions to Slack that may give away answers to other people?
Yes, it is okay! Others may have the same question or learn from your question.

In order to be successful at Prime it is important that everyone approach the hard and sometimes painful parts of programmming in trying to break down a problem and solve it. So if there is a question that addresses a part of an assignment that you haven't seen yet, just skip over it. But you can go back to it laster if needed. Getting the correct answer to a problem isn't as important as the learning process in tackling it.
